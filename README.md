# EPFL Computer Science Notes

> This repository borrows and furthers [a fine tradition from ETH...](https://github.com/dcetin/eth-cs-notes)
> The idea and format, and parts of this README, are copy-paste from the aforelinked repo.

These are notes and cheatsheets for Master courses at EPFL (only CS for now).
They are exclusively based on the primary sources (i.e. lecture slides, tutorials, recordings, exercises).

These notes and cheatsheets are for personal use only. They may contain mistakes. Moreover, for learning purposes I would rather recommend writing your own.

Feel free to update or add your own notes by forking this repo.

- OptML cheatsheet is adapted from the ETH PAI cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/dcetin/eth-cs-notes).
